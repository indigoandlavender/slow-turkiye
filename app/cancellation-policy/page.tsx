              A 30% deposit is required to confirm your booking. This deposit is non-refundable 
              but may be applied to a future journey within 18 months if you cancel more than 
              60 days before departure.

              We'll do our best to accommodate changes to your itinerary, subject to 
              availability. Changes made within 30 days of departure may incur additional 
              fees from our service providers. Significant changes may be treated as a 
              cancellation and rebooking.

              In the rare event that we must cancel your journey due to circumstances beyond

              We strongly recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance that includes 
              trip cancellation coverage. This can protect you from unforeseen circumstances 
              that may require you to cancel or cut short your journey. Please ensure your 
              policy covers the full cost of your trip.
